  <h1>Description</h1>
  <p>Tequeño is a culinary preparation originating from Venezuela that typically consists of a fried wheat flour dough, filled with Venezuelan white cheese. It is consumed as an appetizer, breakfast, fast food or snack.</p>

  <h2>Recipe Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>410 g of flour without baking powder</li>
    <li>240 g cold butter, cubed</li>
    <li>1 tsp Gourmet Sea Salt</li>
    <li>1 egg</li>
    <li>120 ml of water</li>
    <li>500 g of hard white cheese such as llanero or mozzarella</li>
    <li>1 liter of oil for frying</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>In a bowl, put the flour, butter and salt. With your fingers, pinch the butter into the rest of the ingredients until you have a texture like wet sand.</li>
    <li>Add the water and mix until a dough forms. Wrap in film and refrigerate for 1 hour.</li>
    <li>Roll out the dough on a floured surface until it is 2mm thick.</li>
    <li>Cut 3cm wide strips from the dough.</li>
    <li>Cut the llanero cheese into 2 cm strips and wrap them with the dough as if it were a mummy. Once wrapped, rotate them on the table to seal the layers.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oil over medium heat until it reaches 180°C. Add the tequeños and fry for 3-4 minutes or until golden.</li>
  </ol>
